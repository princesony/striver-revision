README for Sorting and Pattern Printing Code
Overview
This JavaScript file contains a variety of functions for sorting algorithms (Selection Sort, Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort) as well as functions for generating different star patterns and number pyramids. The code includes algorithms for searching (binary search) and generating geometric patterns using loops.

Sorting Algorithms
Selection Sort
A sorting algorithm that repeatedly selects the smallest element from the unsorted part of the array and swaps it with the element at the current position.

javascript
Copy code
let selection_Sort = (arr) => { ... }
Bubble Sort
A simple comparison-based sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent items, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

javascript
Copy code
let bubble_Sort = (arr) => { ... }
Merge Sort
A divide-and-conquer algorithm that splits the array into halves recursively, sorts each half, and then merges them back together.

javascript
Copy code
let merge_Sort = (arr) => { ... }
let merge = (left, right) => { ... }
Quick Sort
Another divide-and-conquer algorithm that selects a 'pivot' element and partitions the array into two sub-arrays, one with elements less than the pivot and one with elements greater, and recursively sorts the sub-arrays.

javascript
Copy code
function quick_Sort(arr) { ... }
Binary Search
A fast search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.

javascript
Copy code
function binarySearch(arr, target) { ... }
Pattern Printing Functions
Square Star Pattern
Prints a square pattern of stars (*) with the possibility to add spaces between the stars.

javascript
Copy code
let print_square_Star = (num) => { ... }
Opposite Square Star Pattern
Prints a square pattern of stars (*) but in the opposite direction.

javascript
Copy code
let print_square_Star_opposite = (num) => { ... }
Pyramid Patterns
Multiple pyramid patterns, including:

Basic Pyramid
Pyramid of Numbers
Pyramid with Repeated Numbers
Opposite Pyramid
Middle-aligned Pyramid
Diamond Pattern
javascript
Copy code
let prinst_Peramid_Start = (n) => { ... }
let prinst_Peramid_Num = (n) => { ... }
let prinst_Peramid_Reapet = (n) => { ... }
let oppsite_Peramid = (n) => { ... }
let middle_peramid = (num) => { ... }
Complex Star Pattern (Two Stars with Spaces)
Prints a pattern where stars are placed on both sides with spaces between them, forming an expanding and contracting shape.

javascript
Copy code
function printPattern() { ... }
Square Star Pattern with Opposite Shapes
Creates a pattern of stars on both sides with spaces in between, similar to the mirrored version of the square star pattern.

javascript
Copy code
let print_square_Star_opposite1 = (num) => { ... }
Function Descriptions
Sorting Functions

Selection Sort: Sorts an array by finding the smallest element in the unsorted part and swapping it into place.
Bubble Sort: Repeatedly compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
Merge Sort: Divides the array into halves, recursively sorts them, and merges them.
Quick Sort: Picks a pivot and recursively sorts elements around the pivot using partitioning.
Binary Search: Efficiently searches for a value in a sorted array by halving the search range.
Pattern Printing

Prints a variety of star-based patterns (e.g., squares, pyramids, diamonds).
Functions can also generate number-based pyramids and patterns with decreasing/increasing stars and spaces.
Utility Functions

printPattern(): Prints a complex pattern with stars and spaces to create an expanding and contracting shape.
print_square_Star_opposite1(): Prints a pattern of stars in a mirrored square shape with expanding and contracting rows.
Example Usage
To use any of the sorting algorithms:

javascript
Copy code
let sortedArr = selection_Sort([64, 25, 12, 22, 11]);
console.log(sortedArr); // Output: Sorted array using Selection Sort
To use any of the pattern functions:

javascript
Copy code
print_square_Star(5); // Prints square pattern with stars
prinst_Peramid_Start(5); // Prints pyramid pattern
Notes
These functions use basic JavaScript constructs such as loops, conditions, and array operations.
The sorting functions are fundamental sorting algorithms designed to demonstrate different approaches to sorting.
The pattern printing functions allow for visual representation of shapes and patterns using stars (*) and numbers.
